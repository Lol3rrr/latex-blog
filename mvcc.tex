\title{My Spin on MVCC for a toy database}
\date{October 2023}

\begin{document}
\section{Introduction}
This is just a small idea I had while thinking about how I could implement MVCC for transactions in my custom
toy database.

\section{Idea}


\section{Properties}
These are the core properties that I was interested in, from a standard database point of view
\begin{enumerate}
\item Repetable Reads
\item (Snapshot isolation)
\item (Serializable)
\end{enumerate} \\
However there were some more interesting aspects from a technical point of view as well
\begin{enumerate}
\item Transactions should be as independent as possible
\item Transactiosn should not block each other
\item High scalability
\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
