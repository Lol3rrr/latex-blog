\title{My Spin on MVCC for a toy database}
\date{October 2023}

\begin{document}
\section{Introduction}
This is just a small idea I had while thinking about how I could implement MVCC for transactions in my custom
toy database.

\section{Properties}
These are the core properties that I was interested in, from a standard database point of view
\begin{enumerate}
\item Repetable Reads
\item (Snapshot isolation)
\item (Serializable)
\end{enumerate} \\
However there were some more interesting aspects from a technical point of view as well
\begin{enumerate}
\item Transactions should be as independent as possible
\item Transactiosn should not block each other
\item High scalability
\end{enumerate}

\section{Idea}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $C \subseteq \mathbb{N}$: The Committed Transactions
\item $B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$: The Aborted Transactions
\item $C \cap B = \emptyset$
\item $WT \in \mathbb{N}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Starting a Transaction}
Get a Snapshot of $C_t = C$ and $B_t = B$, these won't change for the entire duration of the Transaction and are what
ensures the "Repetable Read" property
